 * @brief Shared EXECUTION of a Load/Unload/Purge, once filament_op_dispatch.h
 *        has already decided which tier to take.
 *
 * filament_op_dispatch.h (plan_load(), plan_unload()) centralizes the DECISION
 * of which tier a filament operation takes. The act of actually running that
 * tier — building BackendCaps, switching over FilamentTier, dispatching the
 * configured macro or falling back to raw gcode — had begun to diverge the
 * same way across surfaces before this file existed. Extracted from
 * PrintStatusWidget::dispatch_load(), which was the first duplicate of
 * FilamentRunoutHandler's version. FilamentRunoutHandler was converted onto
 * this file too, so both callers now share this execution; FilamentPanel and
 * AmsOperationSidebar still answer the same plan_load()/plan_unload()
 * decision but each run their own independent execution ladder — unconverted
 * follow-up.
