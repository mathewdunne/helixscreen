"""Every string C++ marks for translation must have a non-empty value in every
shipped locale.

`test_explicit_tag_coverage.py` covers the same ground for `*_tag` attributes in
ui_xml. Neither scan sees the other's strings, so without this gate a string that
only ever appears in an `lv_tr()` call reaches the device in English on every
non-English printer with nothing objecting.

The scan is the extractor the sync tool itself uses, so this gate and
`make translation-sync` always agree on what counts as translatable. A string the
extractor deliberately skips (a log line, a format-only fragment, a marked
non-translatable substring) is out of scope here as well.
